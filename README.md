# Data
The Evahan 2026 dataset comprises three datasets, covering image-text pairs: plain text images, mixed image-text images, and handwritten images-text. The data underwent initial automatic annotation, followed by meticulous correction and refinement by experts in classical Chinese language and history to ensure the highest quality of the training materials and gold-standard texts.

- **Dataset A** consists of data selected from the Siku Quanshu (Complete Library of the Four Treasuries), including classics, history, philosophy, and literature, as well as various other ancient books.

- **Dataset B** contains mixed image-text data selected from the Siku Quanshu and other ancient books.


- **Dataset C** includes handwritten ancient books, primarily the Chinese Buddhist canon, including the Korean Buddhist canon, the Chinese Buddhist canon (TKH) dataset, and the Chinese Buddhist canon (MTH) dataset.


## Data Format
All evaluation data are in the form of image-text pairs, and the text is a txt file in Unicode (UTF-8) format. The specific format is shown in Table 1。
